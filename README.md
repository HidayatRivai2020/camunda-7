## Architecture

### Camunda architecture
- Core Engine : The core of Camunda BPM
- Application : Set of application to help modeling, execute, and administer process running on the Camunda core engine
- Cycle : integrate third party BPMN modeler with Camunda BPM
- Custom Application : New application that can integrate with Camunda BPM components
- Design : Design the BPMN
  - Camunda Modeler
    - Dekstop Based Modeler
  - Cawemo
    - Web Based workflow designer
    - Cloud Based Designer
- Automate : Deploy the workflow into camunda engine
  - Cockpit : Managing the workflow which has been deployed
  - Tasklist : Interact with the workflow which has been deployed
  - Workflow Engine : Deploy and execute the workflow
  - Decision Engine : Deploy and execute the decision
- Improve
  - Optimize : Improve the project

### Process Engine Architecture
- Public API : Service Oriented API that allow JAVA Application to interact with process engine
- Core engine : Process Virtual Machine that passed BPMN File into XML file into Java objects and set BPM implementation behavior
- Job Executor : Asynchronous Background Work 
- Persistence Layer : Process instance state to a relational database
- Relational Databse : Database to store the data

### Architectural Options
- Embedded Process Engine
  - Embed the Camunda engine entirely within your current application, preserving its current UX
  - Added as an application library to custom application
  - Can be started and stopped with the application lifecycle
  - Possible to run multiple embedded process engines on top of shared database
- Shared, Container managed Process Engine: 
  - share a process engine or set a process engines among a set of process applications
  - Started inside the runtime container
  - provided as a container service and can be shared by all applications deployed inside the container
- Standalone Process Engines 
  - Standalone configuration that usually accepted calls via REST API
  - provided as a network service
  - different applications running on the network can interact with the process engine through a remote communication channel
- Clustering Model
  - Combination of different architectural option
  - Can be distributed to different nodes in a cluster
  - Connected to a shared database
